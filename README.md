# Hi, I'm Jesse 😄

I'm a product guy. That means I like to fine-tune my work and ship with excellence 💎. Every detail matters to me. 

I'm a forever learner 📚 who loves to absorb information from anyone and everywhere I can. Growing as an individual is what keeps me focused and entertained as I go through life.

I've been fortunate enough to have encountered many different life experiences, like climbing my first mountains recently (☝ 😄). As fellow tech-industry folk, we know how valuable balance and perspective is away from the screen, so we can think more clearly at it. Mountain air be good for ya ha.
